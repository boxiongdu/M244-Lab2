**GitHub: The Coder’s Haven**

In digital  where coders thrive,
A home for dreams comes alive.
Lines of logic, crisp and bright,
Stored in branches, taking flight.

Fork and pull, commit with care,
Versions dancing in the air.
A bug appears—don’t despair,
A PR’s fix is always there.

Merge conflicts, the coder’s plight,
Yet teamwork turns the dark to light.
A global space, where minds unite,
Ideas sparked in endless night.

README guides the lost anew,
Issues tracked, both old and new.
From open source to enterprise,
Innovation never dies.

Oh, GitHub, where creators meet,
In repos vast and cleanly neat.
Through every push and every clone,
You make the digital world our own.

Push your code, make it fly,
Up to GitHub, way up high.
Pull it down, check what's new,
Merge the changes, fix a few.

Branches grow, then combine,
Lines of code now intertwine.
Push again, the work is done,
Collab in sync—devs as one!
